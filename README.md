### About Me
Amused by the Internet, terminal (cli) apps, productivity hacking and travel. I'm a Senior Software Engineer at Razorpay Capital.

At Razorpay, I'm building API-First Fintech solutions for Capital platform in Golang using Domain-driven methodologies (DDD).

Previously, I was working Treebo Hotels where I worked on the revamp of the central reservation system and was responsible for hot migration of hotels (booking data) from the legacy to the new micro-service.

Prior to Treebo, I was leading the tech team at Omnify, Inc. and was primarily working on the scaling and architecting both frontend & backend systems.
