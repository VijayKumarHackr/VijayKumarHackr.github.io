#Welcome to my web page

### About Me
Basically, I enjoy the Internet, computers, blogging, traveling and socializing with quality people. For me, it has been always about leaving the world in a better place than we've found it!

### Views & Philosophy
Although I'm new to real world programming challenges, I've always had a will to contribute free software to the open source community. And yes, if you are wondering about the 'hacker' word in my username, then I wish to add this:

> A hacker to me is someone who enjoys playful cleverness not necessarily with computers.
> - GNU Philosophy.

### Areas of Interest
I'm basically jack of most things (Internet and software) and master of none! I began programming simple web applications in 2012 using PHP and then learned C, Python, JavaScript and Ruby. I'm a Linux lover and an open source enthusiast.

### Projects
I've previous worked on [usersys](https://github.com/VijayKumarHackr/usersys), this was my first project, which was a configurable user system for Laravel. Now I'm currently working on a web based CNC lathe turning simulator, using WebGL and pure client sided JavaScript.
