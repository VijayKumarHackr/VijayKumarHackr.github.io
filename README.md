# Vijay Kumar

### About Me
I'm amused by the Internet, computers, blogging, traveling and socializing with quality people. For me, it has been always about learning something new and solving engineering puzzles!

### Views & Philosophy
Although I'm new to real world programming challenges, I've always had a will to contribute free software to the open source community. And yes, if you are wondering about the 'hacker' word in my username, then I wish to add this:

> A hacker to me is someone who enjoys playful cleverness not necessarily with computers.
> - GNU Philosophy.

### Areas of Interest
I'm basically jack of most things (Internet and software) and master of none! I began programming simple web applications in 2012 using PHP and then learned C, Python, JavaScript and finally stuck with NodeJS. I'm a Linux lover and an open source enthusiast.
