### About Me
Amused by the Internet, computers, blogging and solo-traveling, I'm a Software Development Engineer and a FOSS enthusiast, with 3 years of professional work experience under the belt, with a keen interest to building secure microservices.

### Areas of Interest
Building web application backends, micro-service architecture and Domain Driven Design (DDD). I began programming web applications in 2013 using PHP and did some freelancing in my early college days. Python and Golang are my current go-to languages. I'm a Linux lover and an open source enthusiast.
