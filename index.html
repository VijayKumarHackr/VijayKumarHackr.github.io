        <a id="about-me" class="anchor" href="#about-me" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About Me</h3>

      <p>I'm amused by the Internet, computers, blogging, traveling and socializing
        with quality people. For me, it has been always about learning something
        new and solving engineering puzzles!
      </p>

      <p>I am a Software Engineer (Level 03) working at <a href="https://www.treebo.com">Treebo Hotels</a>.
        My job here is to work with an aggressive and an innovative team to
        design &amp; develop the central reservation system that runs on Python and built on Flask.
        Here, I also maintain the prime hotel front application back-end which is used by FDMs to
        manage and run their operations.
      </p>

      <p>I spend my leisure time (which I rarely get), learning and taking up courses
        on <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/">MIT OCW</a>, through which I try to understand
        the practicalities of Computer Science. I take some time out every now and again,
        to read books (autobiographies) &amp; articles and also to write (seldom).
      </p>

        <a id="views--philosophy" class="anchor" href="#views--philosophy" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Views &amp; Philosophy
      </h3>

      <p>I believe that, the Terminal will always remain the coolest user interface regardless
        of advancement of attractive GUIs. I try accomplishing most of my quests
        via terminal, and someday I will ditch my desktop environment and switch
        to window permanently (retirement plan).</p>

      <p>I'm a GNU/Linux lover and I support &amp; contribute to free and open source
        software (FOSS) community.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>I prefer Vim over Emacs!</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>And yes, if you are wondering about the word 'hackr' (hacker) in my handle/username,
        then I wish to add this:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>A hacker to me is someone who enjoys playful cleverness not necessarily
          with computers.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>GNU Philosophy.</li>
        </ul>

      <p>I would like to educate myself about Algorithms, Computer Networks, Linux Kernel Development,
        and Cryptography &amp; Security.</p>

      <p>Other than computers, I love food, like to travel to exotic places and, occasionally, I do
        find some time for recreational activities.</p>

        <a id="projects" class="anchor" href="#projects" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Projects &amp; Achievements
      </h3>

      <p>I started my professional work experience as a Full Stack Developer at
        <a href="https://www.getomnify.com">Omnify Inc</a> and walked out as a
        Senior Engineer after working for a year (February 2017 to March 2018). 
        My responsibilities here were to develop, deliver and scale the core system that runs
        on LAMP stack. During my tenure, I'd also focused on Developer Operations to
        find and implement effective methods for horizontally scaling of an application.</p>

      <p>I'd also designed and developed APIs, libraries &amp; modules for Kohana framework.</p>

      <p>Wrote a command-line tool for using tumblr in terminal, <a href="http://nvijaykumar.me/teblr/">teblr</a>,
        which supports basic operations such as posting, editings and deleting
        posts.</p>

      <p>I've previously worked on <a href="http://nvijaykumar.me/usersys">usersys</a>,
        this was my first project (somewhat as a git repo), which was a configurable
        user system for Laravel.</p>

      <p>I want to build a web-based CNC lathe
        turning simulator (called <a href="https://github.com/VijayKumarHackr/replica/">replica</a>),
        using WebGL and pure client side JavaScript, which actually was my major
        project (<a href="https://github.com/VijayKumarHackr/simturn/">simturn</a>)
        during my undergraduate degree, where I managed to create a prototype with
        the help of my project guide.</p>

      <p>I have been an information security advisor for various media channels during my graduation.
      And so, I have been published and interviewed by Telegraph and television networks like Zee
      on the topic of ethical hacking and network security.</p>

      <p>Also during my graduation, I'd discovered and reported Cross Site Scripting (XSS),
      SQL injection and Remote Code Execution bugs on college Intranet servers.</p>

      <p>During my college time, I had conducted several workshops at different institutes
      on the topic web development, web security, and ethical hacking to over 600 students.</p>
