        <a id="welcome-to-my-web-page" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-my-web-page" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to my homepage

        <a id="about-me" class="anchor" href="#about-me" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About Me</h3>

      <p>I'm amused by the Internet, computers, blogging, traveling and socializing
        with quality people. For me, it has been always about learning something
        new and solving engineering puzzles!</p>

      <p>I am a Senior Engineer working at <a href="https://www.getomnify.com">Omnify Inc</a>.
        My job here is to develop, deliver and scale the core system that runs
        on LAMP stack. Here, I also focus on Developer Operations to find and implement
        effective methods for horizontally scaling of an application.</p>

      <p>I spend my leisure time (which I rarely get), learning and studying new frameworks
        to understand various programming paradigms. Since I work on a depreciated
        framework, learning such concepts helps me address intricacies by enacting
        new patterns on to the existing system.</p>

      <h3>
        <a id="views--philosophy" class="anchor" href="#views--philosophy" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Views &amp; Philosophy
      </h3>

      <p>I believe that, the Terminal will always remain the coolest user interface regardless
        of advancement of attractive GUIs. I try accomplishing most of my quests
        via terminal, and someday I will ditch my desktop environment and switch
        to window permanently (retirement plan).</p>

      <p>I'm a GNU/Linux lover and I support &amp; contribute to free and open source
        software (FOSS) community.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>I prefer Vim over Emacs!</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>And yes, if you are wondering about the word 'hackr' (hacker) in my handle/username,
        then I wish to add this:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>A hacker to me is someone who enjoys playful cleverness not necessarily
          with computers.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>GNU Philosophy.</li>
        </ul>
      </blockquote>

        </a> Areas of Interest
      </h3>

      <p>I would like to educate myself about Computer Networks, Linux Kernel Development,
        Cryptography, Penetration Testing, Monetizing Blogs &amp; Content Writing.</p>

      <p>Other than computers, I love food, like to travel to exotic places. Sometimes,
        I also like to read books; I admit, it's been a while since I've read my
        last one (I hate self-help and fiction books).</p>

        <a id="projects" class="anchor" href="#projects" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Projects &amp; Achievements
      </h3>

      <p>I designed and developed APIs, libraries &amp; modules for Kohana framework.</p>

      <p>Wrote a command-line tool for using tumblr in terminal, <a href="http://nvijaykumar.me/teblr/">teblr</a>,
        which supports basic operations such as posting, editings and deleting
        posts.</p>

      <p>I've previously worked on <a href="http://nvijaykumar.me/usersys">usersys</a>,
        this was my first project (somewhat as a git repo), which was a configurable
        user system for Laravel.</p>

      <p>I want to build a web-based CNC lathe
        turning simulator (called <a href="https://github.com/VijayKumarHackr/replica/">replica</a>),
        using WebGL and pure client side JavaScript, which actually was my major
        project (<a href="https://github.com/VijayKumarHackr/simturn/">simturn</a>)
        during my undergraduate degree, where I managed to create a prototype with
        the help of my project guide.</p>

      <p>I have been an information security advisor for various media channels during my graduation.
      And so, I have been published and interviewed by Telegraph and television networks like Zee
      on the topic of ethical hacking and network security.</p>

      <p>Also during my graduation, I'd discovered and reported Cross Site Scripting (XSS),
      SQL injection and Remote Code Execution bugs on college Intranet servers.</p>

      <p>During my college time, I had conducted several workshops at different institutes
      on the topic web development, web security, and ethical hacking to over 600 students.</p>
