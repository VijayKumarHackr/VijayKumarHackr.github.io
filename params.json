It has been always about leaving the world in a better place than we've found it!\r\n\r\n### Views & Philosophy\r\nAlthough I'm new to real world programming challenges, I've always had a will to contribute free software to the open source community. And yes, if you are wondering about the 'hacker' word in my username, then I wish to admit that a hacker to me is someone who enjoys playful cleverness not necessarily with computers -- GNU Philosophy.\r\n\r\n### Areas of Interest\r\nI'm basically jack of most things (Internet and software) and master of none! I began programming simple web applications in 2012 using PHP and then learned C, Python, JavaScript and Ruby. I'm currently working on a web based CNC lathe turning simulator, using WebGL and pure client sided JavaScript.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nYou can email me [here](mailto:nvijaykumar2012@gmail.com).\r\n\r\n",
