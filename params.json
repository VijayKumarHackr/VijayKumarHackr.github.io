For me, it has been always about leaving the world in a better place than we've found it!\r\n\r\n### Views & Philosophy\r\nAlthough I'm new to real world programming challenges, I've always had a will to contribute free software to the open source community. And yes, if you are wondering about the 'hacker' word in my username, then I wish to add this:\r\n\r\n> A hacker to me is someone who enjoys playful cleverness not necessarily with computers.\r\n> - GNU Philosophy.\r\n\r\n### Areas of Interest\r\nI'm basically jack of most things (Internet and software) and master of none! I began programming simple web applications in 2012 using PHP and then learned C, Python, JavaScript and Ruby. I'm a Linux lover and an open source enthusiast.\r\n\r\n### Projects\r\nI've previous worked on [usersys](https://github.com/VijayKumarHackr/usersys), this was my first project, which was a configurable user system for Laravel. Now I'm currently working on a web based CNC lathe turning simulator, using WebGL and pure client sided JavaScript.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\n@VijayKumarHackr is my handle on Twitter, Facebook and GitHub. You can email me [here](mailto:nvijaykumar2012@gmail.com) or find me as `C0r3` on Freenode.\r\n\r\n",
